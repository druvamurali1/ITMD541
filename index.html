          <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p> I am Druva, I’m currently pursuing my masters in Information Technology Management and
                I’m specialising in Data Analytics at Illinois Institute of Technology. I’m originally
                from India where I have completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
                I have close to two years of work experience primarily working in customer success
                teams as a Technical Engineer at Hewlett-Packard and Dell Technologies. I most recently
                worked as a Catalog Data Analyst at Amazon where I was focused on ensuring that the
                data that goes onto the Amazon product listings catalog was accurate and error free.
                I wanted to keep learning and developing my skills which led me to pursue my
                masters when I received a scholarship Illinois Tech.
